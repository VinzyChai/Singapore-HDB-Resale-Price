# Project's Title
Singapore HDB Resale Price

# Description 
This project aims to help a young couple assess the Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale market in Singapore, with the goal of purchasing a flat within their budget of $500,000. The analysis identifies key factors that influence resale prices and provides data-driven insights to support an informed decision.

# Import dictionaries 
For numerical computing and data manipulation and plotting different kinds of graphs
```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
For sorting order of data by key/index
```py
from collections import OrderedDict
from operator import itemgetter 
```

# Run the code (Google Colab)
Go to runtime and hit 'run all'

# Dataset
1. Resale transaction by flat type based on registered cases
2. HDB resale price index
3. Resale flat prices

I obtained the dataset from the Data.gov.sg website. All the data is in English and presented in Excel format.

# Usage
Run the code to view the different types of plots generated. Each graph provides a unique perspective on the dataset. For instance, use the line graph to observe the resale price index over time, the bar charts to analyze the total number and average of resale transactions by flat type, the boxplot to explore the distribution of resale prices across towns and floor levels, and the scatter plots to examine the relationship between resale prices and factors like floor area and remaining lease.
