# Singapore-HDB-Resale-Price
This project aims to help a young couple assess the Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale market in Singapore, with the goal of purchasing a flat within their budget of $500,000. The analysis identifies key factors that influence resale prices and provides data-driven insights to support an informed decision.
